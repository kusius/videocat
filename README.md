# Setup your development 
In all platforms the output executables are located in the `build` directory which is 
generated by the build scripts. 

## Windows 
- Run `setup_windows.bat` (only needs to be run once when freshly cloning the repo, or when you get compilation errors due to missing libraries)
- Run `build.bat`
- To debug you can start debugging from vscode (launch.json contains the appropriate configuration)

## OSX
- Install homebrew package manager 
- `brew install (TODO)` 
- `build.sh` or `build.sh release` for a release build
